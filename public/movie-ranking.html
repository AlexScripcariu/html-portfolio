<h2>My top 5 movies and series of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Home Alone 2</h3>
<p>
    I love the New York atmosphere, while the moral teachings
    weren't as apparent as they were in the original film, the
    sequel had much funnier 'kevin' moments and overall it was a joy
    to watch.
</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>
    This movie was great, describing the life of a shunned-down 10 year old.
    The climax of the movie is iconic today and loved by many fans, however
    I think it was somewhat short. Regardless it does outweigh the other parts
    of the movie. There were a lot of moral teachings on family relationships 
    and kindness, so overall great film for all audiences.

<h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>
    As an enjoyer of mathematics and physics, this show is perfect for me. I
    rarely enjoy romcoms and other genres and as this was a comedy 
    (my faovurite), this show is perfect for me. It combines my geek side of my
    brain with a more social. A fun mix of both worlds.
</p>
<h3>Brooklyn 99</h3>
<p>
    Once again another comedy, but this time with a crime genre. I do like the
    element of mystery in these shows as it does 'tickle my fancy' yet
    this show did it well. Mind you, this wasn't as 'academic' as TBBT but
    in terms of the laughs and jokes produced, it definitely has a high mark.
</p>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<p>
    As previously mentioned (or now mentioning), I love mystery shows as they 
    also get me to question the cases and they are fun overall. Now, monk was an
    older TV series yet it had a much greater detectiveness compared to B99. 
    While B99 was more comedy based, Monk was more intensity based.
